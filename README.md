### DevSecOps Enthusiast | Advocate for Open Tech | Suit Up When Needed

Iâ€™m an aspiring **DevSecOps Engineer** who loves automation and security, with a firm belief that **everything tech should be open**. I donâ€™t love the corporate grind, but hey, if it pays the bills and I have to throw on a nice suit once in a while, Iâ€™ll deal with it.

### A Few Things About Me:

- **Automation** is my way of doing the least amount of manual work possible. If I can script it, I will.
- Iâ€™m all about **open-source** and will always find a way to avoid paying for overpriced tools. **The Pirate Bay**? Yeah, big fan.
- **Corporate life?** Not my dream, but if wearing a suit and playing along keeps the rent paid, Iâ€™m not above it.

### Fun (but Accurate) Facts:

- **Capitalism?** Not really my thing, but until the revolution comes, Iâ€™ve got to make a living.
- I spend my days tinkering with tech and my nights findingâ€¦ *creative ways* to get things that shouldnâ€™t have a price tag.
- Fluent in **English, Spanish, French**, and **not wasting money on software** that could be open-source.

### Why Iâ€™m Here:

I believe tech should be **free, open, and accessible** to all. Iâ€™m here to do meaningful work, automate as much as possible, and question why weâ€™re paying for things that should be available to everyone.

### Final Thoughts:

Iâ€™m in this tech world for **open-source**, the chance to automate everything, and maybe a bit of corporate paycheck to keep things rolling. If youâ€™re into **free tech**, donâ€™t mind a bit of rebellion, and know that sometimes youâ€™ve got to suit up to get paid, weâ€™ll get along just fine.
